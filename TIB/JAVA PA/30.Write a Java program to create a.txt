30.Write a Java program to create an interface Playable with a method play() that takes no

implement the Playable interface and override the play() method to play the respective sports.

interface Playable {
    void play();
}

class Football implements Playable {
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing Football");
    }
}

class Volleyball implements Playable {
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing Volleyball");
    }
}

class Basketball implements Playable {
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing Basketball");
    }
}

public class SportsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Playable football = new Football();
        Playable volleyball = new Volleyball();
        Playable basketball = new Basketball();

        football.play();
        volleyball.play();
        basketball.play();
