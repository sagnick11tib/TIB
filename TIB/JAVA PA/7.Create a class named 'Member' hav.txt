7.Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and
'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now,
assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by
making an object of both of these classes and print the same.

class Member {
    String name;
    int age;
    String phoneNumber;
    String address;
    double salary;

    public Member(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.address = address;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void printSalary() {
        System.out.println("Salary: â‚¹" + salary);
    }
}

class Employee extends Member {
    String specialization;

    public Employee(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary, String specialization) {
        super(name, age, phoneNumber, address, salary);
        this.specialization = specialization;
    }
}

class Manager extends Member {
    String department;

    public Manager(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary, String department) {
        super(name, age, phoneNumber, address, salary);
        this.department = department;
    }
}

public class MemberMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee employee = new Employee("John Doe", 30, "1234567890", "123 Main St", 50000, "Programming");
        Manager manager = new Manager("Jane Smith", 40, "9876543210", "456 Oak St", 80000, "IT");

        System.out.println("Employee Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + employee.name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + employee.age);
        System.out.println("Phone Number: " + employee.phoneNumber);
        System.out.println("Address: " + employee.address);
        System.out.println("Specialization: " + employee.specialization);
        employee.printSalary();

        System.out.println("\nManager Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + manager.name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + manager.age);
        System.out.println("Phone Number: " + manager.phoneNumber);
        System.out.println("Address: " + manager.address);
        System.out.println("Department: " + manager.department);
        manager.printSalary();
    }
}
