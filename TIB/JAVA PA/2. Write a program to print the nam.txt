2. Write a program to print the name of students by creating a Student class. If no name is
passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be “Unknown”,
otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of
Student class.

class Student {
    String name;

  
    public Student() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
    }

    public Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void printName() {
        System.out.println("Student name: " + name);
    }
}

public class StudentMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student1 = new Student();
        student1.printName(); 

        Student student2 = new Student("John");
        student2.printName(); 
    }
}
