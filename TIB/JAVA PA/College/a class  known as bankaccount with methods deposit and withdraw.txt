 Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called
deposit() and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the
withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one
hundred.
• BankAccount methods: constructor to accept accnt. No. and balance(initialise with an amount), deposit, withdraw, g
etbalance
• SavingsAccount method: constructor to pass accnt. No. and balance to superclass constructor, override withdraw
• Main class: create an bankaccount with an initial balance,
Deposit amount,
withdraw amount
create savingsaccount with initial balance,
withdraw amount such that balance will be more than 100 after withdrawal
withdraw amount such that balance will be less than 100 after withdrawal
