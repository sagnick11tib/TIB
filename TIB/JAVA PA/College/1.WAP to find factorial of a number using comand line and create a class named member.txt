1.WAP to find factorial of a number using command line arguments
Hint: int a = Integer.parseInt(args[0])
-----------------------------------------------------
public class FactorialCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.out.println("Please provide exactly one integer as a command line argument.");
            return;
        }

        int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
            return;
        }

        long factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}

2.Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and
'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now,
assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by
making an object of both of these classes and print the same.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Member {
    String name;
    int age;
    String phoneNumber;
    String address;
    double salary;

    Member(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.address = address;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    void printSalary() {
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
}

class Employee extends Member {
    String specialization;

    Employee(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary, String specialization) {
        super(name, age, phoneNumber, address, salary);
        this.specialization = specialization;
    }
}

class Manager extends Member {
    String department;

    Manager(String name, int age, String phoneNumber, String address, double salary, String department) {
        super(name, age, phoneNumber, address, salary);
        this.department = department;
    }
}

public class MemberDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee employee = new Employee("John Doe", 30, "1234567890", "123 Main St", 50000.0, "Java Developer");
        Manager manager = new Manager("Jane Smith", 35, "9876543210", "456 Park Ave", 80000.0, "IT Department");

        System.out.println("Employee Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + employee.name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + employee.age);
        System.out.println("Phone Number: " + employee.phoneNumber);
        System.out.println("Address: " + employee.address);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + employee.salary);
        System.out.println("Specialization: " + employee.specialization);
        employee.printSalary();

        System.out.println("\nManager Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + manager.name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + manager.age);
        System.out.println("Phone Number: " + manager.phoneNumber);
        System.out.println("Address: " + manager.address);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + manager.salary);
        System.out.println("Department: " + manager.department);
        manager.printSalary();
    }
}
