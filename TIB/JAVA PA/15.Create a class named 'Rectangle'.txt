15.Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and two
methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its constructor having
parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle.
Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor having a parameter for its
side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area and
perimeter of a rectangle and a square.
Now repeat the above example to print the area of 10 squares.
Hint-Use array of objects

class Rectangle {
    int length;
    int breadth;

    public Rectangle(int length, int breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle: " + (length * breadth));
    }

    void perimeter() {
        System.out.println("Perimeter of Rectangle: " + 2 * (length + breadth));
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    public Square(int side) {
        super(side, side);
    }
}

public class RectangleSquareInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 8);
        rectangle.area();
        rectangle.perimeter();

        Square square = new Square(4);
        square.area();
        square.perimeter();
    }
}
